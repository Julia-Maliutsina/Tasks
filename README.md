<a href="https://julia-maliutsina.github.io/Tasks/"><h2>Link to gh-pages</h2></a>

<p>Before sign up only "about" page is available. User has to fill sign up or sign in form to get access to other pages. </p>
<p>After sign up (using "note app training server") user is redirected to "profile" page. There are no notes at "notes" and "shared-notes" pages, as the user is new.</p>
<p>After sign in user is also redirected to "profile" page. To test sign in 2 users have been added:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>email: Sincere@april.biz password: qwerty123</li>
  <li>email: Shanna@melissa.tv  password: 123qwerty</li>
  </ul>
<p>Their notes are available at "notes" and "shared-notes" pages.</p> 
<p>Order of user's notes can be changed by drag&drop. User's notes can be changed, new notes can be added. However "note app training server" hasn't been applied here yet, so changes won't be displayed.</p>
